# CLIMAX.World
I am a student passionate about climate and environmental sciences, and I recently started a personal project: creating a small database of Python scripts dedicated to climate data analysis.

The purpose of these scripts is to simplify the creation of graphs, statistics, maps, and other tools for exploring climate data. As a beginner in programming, I designed these codes to be accessible to everyone, even those with little or no experience with Python. My goal is to share a practical resource for anyone who wants to start programming while exploring climate sciences.

Whether you are a student, an enthusiast, or simply curious, this collection of scripts could be a great starting point for learning how to work with climate data in a simple and interactive way.

## Features
- Easy-to-use Python scripts for analyzing climate data.
- Tools for creating graphs, statistics, and maps.
- Accessible for beginners with little or no experience in programming.
